Caldera Forms allows you to create complex grid based, responsive forms quickly and easily. It features an easy to use drag and drop layout builder and stackable form processors to handle submissions elegantly.

== Description ==
Caldera Forms is a free, simple form builder with a layout builder that enables you to create the format you want for your form. It is fully responsive and with form processors, it gives you flexibility to handle the form data how you need it.

Add form processors to your forms to have the data go where you need it. Yo can stack up processors to have them do multiple tasks. Currently, there is only an Auto-Responder and Redirect processor, but more are coming.

Advanced conditional logic take away the basic "Match all or one" and gives you conditional groups. This allows you to create simple conditionals or complex, multi-condition matching.

Everything can be extended. For developers, there are enough hooks and filters to build on. From frontend handling, to form processing, to editor panels, to field types. At it's core, it's a framework for building applications so you can make what you want.

This is only the first version and much more is coming.
